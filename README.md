# Voice-Enabled-Chatbot
The code implements a voice-enabled chatbot system that interacts with users through speech recognition and synthesis. It leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques for text preprocessing, similarity calculation, sentiment analysis, and translation. Users can communicate with the chatbot using voice input, which is converted to text for processing. The chatbot analyzes user queries, finds the most relevant responses from a dataset, determines the sentiment of user input, and translates text to another language (Urdu). With its ability to understand and respond to user speech, analyze sentiment, and translate text, the code demonstrates a versatile application of NLP in conversational AI.
